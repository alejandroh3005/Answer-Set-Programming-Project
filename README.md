## Technologies:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com): Version 4.10.1
* [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/): Version 5.5.0

### Anaconda Installation
$ git clone https[]()://github.com/ricardoaxelbaeza/CHOBS-Project.git
* Anaconda Installation Link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
* Install Anaconda for Mac OS: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos
* Install Anaconda for Windows: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows
* On the command line:
  * $ cd ../path/to/the/file
  * $ conda --v
  * $ conda install -c potassco clingo

### Repository Setup
* Clone the repository using 'git clone https<nolink>://github.com/ricardoaxelbaeza/CHOBS-Project.git'
* [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
* Make sure Anaconda is installed, this can be done by entering 'conda --v' into the terminal
* Change Directory to where the project was cloned
* After making sure Anaconda is installed, we then need to install clingo. 
* Clingo is installed by entering 'conda install -c potassco clingo' into the terminal command line

### Running .lp files
* So after clingo is installed with anaconda:
* To run a .lp file: make sure that you are in the correct folder/path that the .lp file is in
* In the terminal type: 
  * $ clingo nameOfFile.lp
* If you wish to see all possible solutions (type 0): 
  * $ clingo nameOfFile.lp 0
* Specific amount of solutions (type x: x is 1,2,3 etc.)
  * $ clingo nameOfFile.lp 1

### Visualizing files
* Note: Make sure that the python visalization is in the folder that is being tested
  * $ python3 sodoku_viz.py nameOfFile.txt

### Running 'Demo' Juypter Notebook
1. Open Command Prompt and change directory to project repository
2. Activate a conda environment that has clingo installed by calling 'conda activate env_name'
3. Enter 'jupyter notebook' on the terminal; A page will open up from the browser
4. Click on the demo.ipynb on the root directory page
5. Press the â–¶ Run Button on the toolbar

## Achievements:
* Read papers of Answer Set Programming (ASP) with AnsProlog
* Completed first Answer Set Programming example: NQueens.lp
* Visualized output from NQueens.lp
* Completed first successful test sudoku.lp file!
* Visualized output from sudoku.lp
* Initiated Jupyter Notebook
* **Completed encoding of classic Sudoku**
* Visualized classic Sudoku solutions
